# PRODE: Neighborhood Informed Essential and Context Essential scores

PRODE is a tool that integrates Gene Effects data and Protein-Protein Interactions to
compute, for each gene, Neighborhood-Informed Essential (NIE) or Neighborhood-Informd Context Essential (NICE) scores. 

**N.B.: the documentation of the tool is being updated and still work-in-progress.**

## Installation

PRODE is currently available as the R package prodeTool. 
It can be installed from github with: 

```
devtools::install_github('cantorethomas/prodeTool')
```

## Quick example 
For a quick run and example, NIE and NICE scores can be computed as reported in the `example/run_tests.R`
